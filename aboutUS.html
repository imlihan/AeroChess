                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p id="demo">To make what is now known as some of the best chess sets at St Pauls Collegiate to date we first came up with the idea of selling chess sets. So we started. After working all through the holidays, sacrificing exam study time and missing out on weekends to shop for supplies we had our prototype. It was just what we wanted, simple but still looking amazing. The shinning silver and gold finish went perfectly with the luxerious wooden board. To top it all off we sold it at the best product convention of 2017, the St Pauls Collegiate Enterprise evening.</p>
